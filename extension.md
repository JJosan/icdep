<h1>Extension</h1>
<h2>Send to any individual on the whole UW campus</h2>
In the header of the card, we will put the student id of the student that the card is meant to reach. The card is passed to people who know the student until the card reaches the person.

<h2>Specify whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values</h2>
In the header of the card, we could write down how the contents of the card is encoded. In this case, we could write "encode: Unicode" or any of the other options that are available.

<h2>Keep a record of what nodes the card has passed through</h2>
When the card is passed to another person (node), the person writes their name in the header of the card so that when it reaches the destination, we will get a list of everyone that was in contact with the card.
